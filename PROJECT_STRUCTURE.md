## üìä **Model Relationships Summary**

| App | Models | Key Relationships |
|-----|--------|-------------------|
| **authentication** | 4 models | Base user system, referenced by all apps |
| **products** | 4 models | Referenced by inventory, manufacturing, logistics |
| **inventory** | 3 models | References products, manufacturing |
| **manufacturing** | 3 models | References products, processes, resources |
| **processes** | 4 models | References products, used by manufacturing |
| **resources** | 2 models | References processes, used by manufacturing |
| **quality** | 3 models | References processes, manufacturing |

## üöÄ **Benefits of This Structure**

### **1. Maintainability**
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Each app has a focused responsibility
- **Reduced complexity**: Smaller, manageable codebases per domain
- **Easy debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific domains

### **2. Scalability**
- **Independent scaling**: Apps can be scaled independently
- **Microservices ready**: Easy to extract apps into separate services
- **Team collaboration**: Different teams can work on different apps

### **3. Development Experience**
- **Phase-based development**: Implement features in logical phases
- **Parallel development**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- **Clear dependencies**: Easy to understand inter-app relationships

### **4. Business Alignment**
- **Domain-driven design**: Apps align with business domains
- **Stakeholder communication**: Easy to map features to business areas
- **Feature planning**: Clear roadmap based on implementation phases

## üõ†Ô∏è **Development Guidelines**

### **Adding New Features**
1. Identify the appropriate app based on business domain
2. Check dependencies and ensure proper foreign key relationships
3. Update admin configurations for new models
4. Add appropriate tests for the new functionality

### **Cross-App Communication**
- Use Django's foreign key relationships for data consistency
- Implement signals for cross-app notifications
- Consider using Django's contenttypes framework for generic relationships

### **Migration Strategy**
- Each app maintains its own migrations
- Use data migrations for complex transformations
- Test migrations thoroughly in development environment
